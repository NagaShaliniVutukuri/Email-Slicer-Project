# Email-Slicer-Project

The Email Slicer project is a simple yet practical tool that demonstrates basic string manipulation and input processing techniques. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of its functionality:

# Email-Slicer is designed to:
input: The user provides an email address, such as user@example.com.

Extract and separate the username and domain:

The username is the part of the email before the @ symbol (user in the example).
The domain is the part of the email after the @ symbol (example.com in the example).

# Working Process
Input Handling: The program prompts the user to enter a valid email address.

String Splitting: Using the split() function or similar string operations, the program separates the input into two parts:

Before the @ symbol (username)

After the @ symbol (domain)

Output: The program then displays the extracted username and domain in a user-friendly format.

# Examples
Input:

Enter your email address: user@example.com

Output:

Username: user

Domain: example.com
